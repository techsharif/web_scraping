(d)Some form of interactive widget must be added to your front-end GUI to allow the
user to decide whether or not they want the details of their current invoice stored and
to see that this has been done.
(e)When an invoice is generated and this function is activated, your back-end program
must save details of all the most recent purchases in a supplied SQLite database,
shopping_trolley.db. A copy of this database accompanies these instructions.
It contains a single table, Purchases, which has two columns, Description and
Price. Your program must populate these columns with the description and price
(in Australian dollars) of all the items listed in the latest invoice.
